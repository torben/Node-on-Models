Node-on-Models
==============

Node-on-Models is a very simple framework to have models like rails in node and push them via a websocket like socket.io to the client.

### The goals:

* Non blocking from server to client
* synchronous client and server models
* realtime updates for models and collections
* more backbone and node for the world

The current state is... pre-pre-alpha.
